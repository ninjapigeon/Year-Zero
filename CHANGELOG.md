# CHANGELOG
v1.0.5 - apparently "id" is not recognized pre v10 Foundry. Also more typo corrections.

v1.0.4 - deeper dive into variable and characrer rnaming.

v1.0.3 - further renaming. Base system works, but character creation doesn't spawn sheet. (?)

v1.0.2 - file and variable renaming, for internal consistency

v1.0.1 - trying and failing

v1.0.0 - imported @happysteve's M:YZ version
