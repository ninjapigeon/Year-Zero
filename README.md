# Year-Zero

The Open Source Year Zero system for FoundryVTT. Homebrewed specifically for my world Anka.

## Character Types:

**MUTANTS**,\ (placeholder for generic characters)
**NPC** -> a shorter version of a mutant/animal/robot/human \
**ARK**

## Abilities:

**_Mutations** are all represented by an Item called **ability**.\
Once created you can set the _ability_ to be one of the _4 types_.\
If you drag and ability that is not related to the specific character type to it's sheet it will be automaticaly converted to match.\
_For example if you drag an Animal Power to a Robot sheet the ability will be automaticaly converted to a Module._

## Talents - Secondary Functions:

Both **_Talents and Secondary Functions_** are represented by an Item called **Talent**.

-   You can specify the type of the talent on the Talent Item Sheet or
-   Talents dragged to a robot sheet or created from a robot sheet will be named 'Secondary Functions'.

The above is all a work in progress as i migrate this to the OpenSource System.
